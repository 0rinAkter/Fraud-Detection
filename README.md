# Fraud-Detection

I will examine the contents of the notebook and draft a suitable README file for GitHub. Let me process the notebook.

The notebook contains code cells, markdown cells, and visualizations related to credit card fraud detection. I'll create a concise README file for GitHub, detailing the purpose, setup instructions, and features of the project.

Here's the README content for your GitHub project:

# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is highly imbalanced, representing real-world scenarios.

## Features

- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to understand the data distribution and patterns.
- Implementation of machine learning models for fraud detection, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model performance on imbalanced datasets.
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Visualizations for model performance comparison.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.git
    cd Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains anonymized transaction details with features such as `Amount` and `Time`.

## Results

The project demonstrates effective handling of class imbalance and compares the performance of various machine learning models for fraud detection.
